# MovingShapes
## Type: OpenGL ES Android 2.0 App
This sample Native Android program creates a Sphere with vertical movement and a transparent triangle. 
All the effects are created through OpenGL ES 2.0 code.<br>
I created the app for an Android Development exam.<br>
All the vertices are built manually, with trigonometric functions. Thus, this code can freely be used as base to build a sphere (even in other languages).<br>

Version: 1.0<br>
